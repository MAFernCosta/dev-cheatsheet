# dev-cheatsheet

I built this project to turn my programming notes into something visual, organized, and easy to browse.  
Instead of digging through text files or PDFs, I can quickly review topics directly through a clean, web-based interface.  
It’s both a personal learning tool and a small React practice project.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Organise my programming course notes as clean, scannable cheat sheets.
- Practice using **Git**, , **GitHub**, and **GitHub Pages**.
- Keep everything in one place: Bash, SQL, and future topics.
